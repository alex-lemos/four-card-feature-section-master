## My process

I have to organize an entire HTML structure, with main, header and section.

To position the cards well, I left two outside a div and two inside a div, where I used flexbox to put the ones inside a div, one on top of the other, which was undoubtedly my biggest challenge and the spacing made with margin.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use fexxbox properties in a more efficient way and to better organize my HTML code and, besides, I managed to keep my CSS code organized, using BEM.
